Before opening the source code folder, it is advisible to read the report carefully. 

In the data folder, feature vector contains 8000 rows and 11 columns where 8000 rows indicate the measurements of the observations that also known as the instance of the class. There are 10 features (Column 1st to 10th) for each instances of the observations. Last column (11th) indicates the class label (+1 or -1) corresponding to each instance. In this data set, there are 2 class which are +1 and -1. The overall work flow used for implementation is shown in Figure below.
